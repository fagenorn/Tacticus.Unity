# Idea
Tactical level battle simulator using real-life equipment to simulate battle. The player would prepare all the variables in regards to the battle such as terrain, equipment, vehicles and, weather. Once the simulation starts, the player would not have any effect on the outcome of the battle itself.

This would be an excellent tool for historical re-enactments, as it would give people a more realistic experience of what it was like to fight in a particular battle.
The game is a mix of ultimate battle simulator and Arma 3.
